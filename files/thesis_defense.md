# Tips on defense presentation
## Defense presentation is as important as thesis! Make your best effort on the slides.

## Defense committee
* Your advisor will not be in your committee
* The advisor name is not revealed to committee
  * Need to hide your advisor's name (e.g., __XXX__) if you cite advisor's journal paper.
* Due to the increasing number, `quant` theses are allocated to the committee with a professor in the field. 

# Contents of slides
* __Introduction__: Make introduction interesting 
* __Summary (contribution) slide__: Put before the main result slides
  * Summarize your contribution
* Effectively use underline, boldface font, color, or text box to emphasize.
* __"Thank you" slide__: Put conclusion. You may repeat the summary slide. 
* __"Appendix" slides__: 
  * Put after "Thank you" slide just in case 
  * E.g. robustness check. Gives an impression of your effort.
* __"Reference" slides__: list references.	
* Deliver one point in each slide
* Overall, __20__ pages are maximum.

## General tips
* Do not argue with committee
  * Not because professors are always right
* What is the limitations of your thesis?
  * Helps prepare the defense strategy.
  * Sometimes, admitting the limitations in advance helps
* Come to research seminar and watch how they are organized
* Practice! Practice! Practice!
  * Thesis seminar is a good opportunity. (Prof. Chu is always harsh.)
  * Try your best to finish a good draft before thesis seminar.
  * Do mock defense several times (among friends or before advisor).

## Tips on quantitative topics
* Clarify the goal of thesis in the summary slide
  * Mathematical methods / computational gain
  * Professors in the non-quant area may not be familiar with the goals. So give them a nice warning.


## Words you don't have to say in defense
* `Dear respected professors` (`Good morning/afternoon, professors` is good enough.)
* `Thank you professor for a your wonderful question.`
* `I will study in the future.` (unless you are going to Ph.D.)

## Same rules apply to defense slides
* Define abbreviation in the beginning: Black Scholes (BS)
* Avoid informal language
* Be consistent with your thesis: references, formula, etc
